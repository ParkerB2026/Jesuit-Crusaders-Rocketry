# Jesuit-Crusaders-Rocketry

Welcome to the Jesuit Crusaders Rocketry Github!  This repo is dedicated to the sharing and distribution of online resources used by the Jesuit rocketry club.  The resources in the repo include technical documentation, avionics code, and CAD files.  Whether you are on the team or not (or even a student at Jesuit High school Portland), the JCR repo is opensource and using the files provided is welcome!

Technical Documentation:

Technical documentation typically includes detailed written materials such as manuals, schematics, and design specifications that describe the theory, design, assembly, and operation of the rocket and its components.  One example is the developmental log for the team's air brake mechanism.  

Code:

Software programs and scripts used to control the rocket's electronic systems, such as navigation, communication, and data collection, ensuring that the rocket can perform its intended functions accurately and safely.  Code on the repo also include flight simulations, part optimization, etc.

CAD Files (3D models & PCB schematics):

CAD (Computer-Aided Design) files include the mechanical and electrical design of rocket subsystems.  The mechanical cad documents are step. or stl. files.  Certain files on the repo are components for Arrow 1, the team's testbed workhorse rocket.  Other cad files are PCB schematics (printed circuit boards) which are models that outline the electrical design of avionic subsystems.  Mechanical CAD here at JCR is done through Onshape.  PCB design is conducted using Kicad.
